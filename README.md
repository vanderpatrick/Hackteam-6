[Back to top ⇧](#)

#### Strategy

Strategy incorporates user needs as well as product objectives. This website will focus on the following target audience, divided into three main categories:

- **Roles:**

  - New users
  - Returning users

- **Demographic:**

  - All ages

- **Psychographic:**

  - Lifestyles:

    - Interest in LGBTQ+ community
    - Interest in human rights

  - Personality/Attitudes:
    - Open-minded
    - Respectful
    - Inclusive
    - Supportive of diversity

The website is supposed to enable the **user** to:

- select a country by moving and clicking the mouse.
- retrieve the information on the history of the Pride movement events in a particular country.
- get the information in a form of a short text about history and an image of the event.
- suggest a change or an update of the information on the site.

#### Scope

The scope plane defines requirements based on the goals established on the strategy plane. So, accordingly, the identified required features are broken into the following categories:

- Content Requirements:
  - ## The user will be looking for:
    - the information about some significant Pride event in particular country.
    - the information about the interaction on the Map Page.
    - the form by which they will be able to contribute to the info on the site.
- Functionality Requirements:
  - ## The user will be able to:
    - easily navigate through the pages wether they want to know more about the site, use the world map interactively to retrieve the info, or send the contributing information.
    - hover over the world map and select the country about which they want to retrieve the info about Pride.
    - send the information about the Pride events that aren't presented on the world map or update the existing ones by contact form.

#### Structure

The above mentioned information were organized in a site map, showing how users can navigate through the site with ease and efficiency:

<details>
<summary>Site Map</summary>

![Site Map](./docs/sitemap.png)

</details>

#### Skeleton and Wireframes

For this project, we used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) in the initial design phase, before the coding process. This enabled us to develop the website's structure, skeleton, layout and overall look and style. We created designs for desktop, tablet and mobile screens to ensure that responsiveness was at the forefront of the application from the beginning.

### Design,Layout and Structure

#### Colour Scheme

The default colour scheme was made by [Canva Color Palette Generator](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/).
The colours were selected from existing Tailwind CSS classes. They were chosen as they correspond nicely with the hero image.

<details>
<summary>Colour Palette</summary>
    
![Colour Palette](./docs/colour-palette.png)

</details>

To that colour scheme, there was added Medium Turquoise colour (#38D2D2) for the buttons with 3d effect from the website [Beautiful CSS buttons examples](https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples).
The same colour was used for the gradient effect on the navbar, with the help of [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/) web app.

#### Typography

Fonts used on the website are from the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), namely **Carter One** and **Oxygen**. Carter One appears in the Logo, whilst Oxygen in the rest of the website.
