## Criteria

In this section, we will briefly discuss how our team addressed the applicable criteria:

- ✨ What Framework was used?
- ✨ How innovative is the idea and project?
- ✨ Was the README Template used and expanded upon?
- ✨ Was the GitHub Project used to plan and execute the project?
- ✨ Is the project completed and deployed?

## Intro

Out and About is an exciting project that aims to create an interactive world map showcasing Pride events happening across different countries. The project focuses on promoting inclusivity, diversity, and the celebration of LGBTQ+ communities worldwide.
With the Out and About platform, users will have the opportunity to explore a dynamic map that highlights some important Pride events. By clicking on specific countries, users can access some general information about each event, including dates, locations, and event descriptions or can contribute to the project by sending updated or missing information. Out and About aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for the LGBTQ+ community and allies, fostering a sense of unity and awareness about Pride celebrations worldwide.

## User Experience

### Project Goals

The primary goal of the project is to create an interactive website which allows users to find information about key events relating to the LGBTQ+ liberation movement in different countries. Additionally, the users are encouraged to submit suggestions of events they would like to be featured on the map.

### Target Audience

- People interested in Queer history;
- People who want to learn more about liberation movements across the world;
- People identifying as a part of the LGBTQ+ community;
- People wanting to become better allies.

### User Requirements and Expectations

- An intuitive navigation system;
- A way to find relevant information easily;
- Website functions to work as expected;
- A visually appealing design;
- Accessibility.
- An easy way to contact the site owners.

### User Stories

#### **First-time user**

1. As a new user, I want to identify the purpose of the website.
2. As a new user, I want to navigate the site intuitively and with ease.
3. As a new user, I want the instructions to be easily found, clear, and concise.
4. As a new user, I want the visual content to be attractive, appealing and relevant to the site content.
5. As a new user, I want to be able to easily find more information about the project.

#### **Returning user**

1. As a returning user, I want to be able to send information about events I think should be featured on the map to the site owners.
2. As a returning user, I want to be able to view the site on a range of different devices.
3. As a returning user, I want to be able to contact the site owners to suggest an update to the information featured on the site.

### Development Planes

In order to create an interactive website that allows the user to get useful information about the history of the Pride events in different countries, the following planes are made.

[Back to top ⇧](#)

#### Strategy

Strategy incorporates user needs as well as product objectives. This website will focus on the following target audience, divided into three main categories:

- **Roles:**

  - New users
  - Returning users

- **Demographic:**

  - All ages

- **Psychographic:**

  - Lifestyles:

    - Interest in LGBTQ+ community
    - Interest in human rights
    - Interest in traveling and knowing about the LBTQ+ events of the country they visit

  - Personality/Attitudes:
    - Open-minded
    - Respectful
    - Inclusive
    - Supportive of diversity

The website is supposed to enable the **user** to:

- select a country by moving and clicking the mouse.
- retrieve the information on the history of the Pride movement events in a particular country.
- get the information in a form of a short text about history and an image of the event.
- suggest a change or an update of the information on the site.

Taking all into consideration, the following strategy table shows the corrispondence of importance and viability.

<details>
<summary>Importance and Viability Table</summary>

![Viability Table](#)

</details>

#### Scope

The scope plane defines requirements based on the goals established on the strategy plane. So, accordingly, the identified required features are broken into the following categories:

- Content Requirements:
  - ## The user will be looking for:
    - the information about some significant Pride event in particular country.
    - the information about the interaction on the Map Page.
    - the form by which they will be able to contribute to the info on the site.
- Functionality Requirements:
  - ## The user will be able to:
    - easily navigate through the pages wether they want to know more about the site, use the world map interactively to retrieve the info, or send the contributing information.
    - hover over the world map and select the country about which they want to retrieve the info about Pride.
    - send the information about the Pride events that aren't presented on the world map or update the existing ones by contact form.

#### Structure

The above mentioned information were organized in a site map, showing how users can navigate through the site with ease and efficiency:

<details>
<summary>Site Map</summary>

![Site Map](#)

</details>

#### Skeleton and Wireframes

For this project, we used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) in the initial design phase, before the coding process. This enabled us to develop the website's structure, skeleton, layout and overall look and style. We created designs for desktop, tablet and mobile screens to ensure that responsiveness was at the forefront of the application from the beginning.

### Design,Layout and Structure

#### Colour Scheme

The default colour scheme was made by [Canva Color Palette Generator](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/).

![Pastel Colour Palette](./docs/readme_images/pridepalette1.png)

To that colour scheme, there was added Medium Turquoise colour (#38D2D2) for the buttons with 3d effect from the website [Beautiful CSS buttons examples](https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples).
The same colour was used for the gradient effect on the navbar, with the help of [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/) web app.

#### Typography

Fonts used on the website are from the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), namely **Carter One** and **Oxygen**. Carter One appears in the Logo, whilst Oxygen in the rest of the website.
