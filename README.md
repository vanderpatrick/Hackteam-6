## Intro

Out and About is an exciting project that aims to create an interactive world map showcasing Pride events happening across different countries. This Full Stack project focuses on promoting inclusivity, diversity, and the celebration of LGBTQ+ communities worldwide.
With the Out and About platform, users will have the opportunity to explore a dynamic map that highlights some important Pride events. By clicking on specific countries, users can access some general information about each event, including dates, locations, and event descriptions or can contribute to the project by sending updated or missing information. Out and About aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for the LGBTQ+ community and allies, fostering a sense of unity and awareness about Pride celebrations worldwide.

## User Experience

### Project Goals

The primary goal of the project is to create an interactive website which allows users to find information about key events relating to the LGBTQ+ liberation movement in different countries. Additionally, the users are encouraged to submit suggestions of events they would like to be featured on the map.

### Target Audience

### Development Planes

In order to create an interactive website that allows the user to get useful information about the history of the Pride events in different countries, the following planes are made.

[Back to top â‡§](#)

#### Strategy

The strategy incorporates user needs as well as product objectives. This website will focus on the following target audience, divided into three main categories:

- **Roles:**

  - New users
  - Returning users

- **Demographic:**

  - All ages

- **Psychographic:**

  - Lifestyles:

    - Interest in the LGBTQ+ community
    - Interest in human rights
    - Interest in travelling and knowing about the LBTQ+ events of the country they visit

  - Personality/Attitudes:
    - Open-minded
    - Respectful
    - Inclusive
    - Supportive of diversity

The website is supposed to enable the **user** to:

- select a country by moving and clicking the mouse.
- retrieve the information on the history of the Pride movement events in a particular country.
- get the information in a form of a short text about the history and an image of the event.
- suggest a change or an update of the information on the site.

#### Scope

The scope plane defines requirements based on the goals established on the strategy plane. So, accordingly, the identified required features are broken into the following categories:

- Content Requirements:
  - The user will be looking for:
    1. the information about some significant Pride events in a particular country.
    2. the information about the interaction on the Map Page.
    3. the form by which they will be able to contribute to the info on the site.
- Functionality Requirements:
  - The user will be able to:
    1. easily navigate through the pages whether they want to know more about the site, use the world map interactively to retrieve the info, or send the contributing information.
    2. hover over the world map and select the country about which they want to retrieve the info about Pride.
    3. retrieve the Pride events in a certain country by its name in a search bar.
    4. send the information about the Pride events that aren't presented on the world map or update the existing ones by contact form.

#### Structure

The above mentioned information was organized in a site map, showing how users can navigate through the site with ease and efficiency:

<details>
<summary>Site Map</summary>

![Site Map](./docs/sitemap.png)

</details>

#### Skeleton and Wireframes

For this project, we used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) in the initial design phase, before the coding process. This enabled us to develop the website's structure, skeleton, layout and overall look and style. We created designs for desktop, tablet and mobile screens to ensure that responsiveness was at the forefront of the application from the beginning.

### Design,Layout and Structure

#### Colour Scheme

The default colour scheme was made by [Canva Color Palette Generator](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/).
The colours were selected from existing Tailwind CSS classes. They were chosen as they correspond nicely with the hero image.

<details>
<summary>Colour Palette</summary>
    
![Colour Palette](./docs/colour-palette.png)

Default black and white colours were generally used for the paragraphs and text elements.

#### Typography

Fonts used on the website are from the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), namely **Oxygen** and **Oswald**.

#### Imagery

The images are taken from different sources and are credited in the Credits of this file. The main sources were:

### Features to Implement in future

- **Direct info input on the map** - This feature would allow the user to pinpoint into the map and choose to add the details directly by a pop-up window. The information would be sent to the API and the admin could decide to validate it if proven credible.
- **Image display of the events** - Although planned in the database as a possibility, the display of an image related to the event recorded in the database wasn't implemented because of lack of time.

The [JSHint JavaScript Code Quality Tool](https://jshint.com/) was also used to validate the site's `JS` code. Python validation was made by the Code Institute [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) validation web app.
